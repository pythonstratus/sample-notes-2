Here's how I'd respond to Jay's concern:

**Hi Jay,**

You're absolutely right to think through this carefully. Your concern about the sequence serving different purposes is valid, but I think there might be a misunderstanding about how sequences work in this context.

**The Key Point**: The TINSIDCNT sequence is just a **counter** - it generates unique numbers. Whether Legacy or Modernized calls it, the sequence just returns the next available number (254223194, 254223195, etc.). The sequence itself doesn't know or care what process is using those numbers.

**What Actually Happens**:
- Legacy process inserts record, gets TIN_SID = 254223194
- Modernized process inserts the **same business record**, gets TIN_SID = 254223195
- Now we have two different TIN_SIDs for what should be the same data

**With Database Link**:
- Both processes would get the **same number** for the **same business record**
- The sequence still serves its purpose (unique identification)
- But now identical records have identical TIN_SIDs

The goal isn't to have both systems increment the same sequence simultaneously, but to ensure that when both systems process the same business data, they generate the same TIN_SID values for verification purposes.

Does this clarify the approach? Happy to discuss further if you have other concerns.

**[Your name]**

This response acknowledges his valid thinking while gently correcting the misunderstanding about how the sequence would be used.
