**Subject: Database Link Implementation for TINSIDCNT Sequence - Scripts Ready**

Hi DBA Team,

I've attached the database link implementation scripts for our sequence synchronization project. This is a simpler approach than GoldenGate that will solve our data validation issues.

**Files Attached:**
- `als_sequence.sql` - Run on ALS Legacy system first
- `entity_sequence.sql` - Run on ENTITYDEV Exadata after ALS completion

**What You Need to Do:**

**ALS Team (run als_sequence.sql first):**
Connect via SQLPLUS as SYSDBA and make these quick changes before running:
- Update the password on line 35 (currently "EntityDev2025!Link") to meet your security standards
- The script will tell you what SEQUENCE_OWNER value to use - just replace it throughout
- Takes about 10 minutes, then send ENTITYDEV team the connection details

**ENTITYDEV Team (run entity_sequence.sql after ALS is done):**
Connect via SQLPLUS as the schema owner and customize these items:
- Lines 65-67: Update ALS_HOSTNAME, ALS_SERVICE_NAME, and password (get from ALS team)
- Throughout script: Replace SEQUENCE_OWNER with the value ALS team provides
- Takes about 20 minutes

**The Result:**
Both systems will use the same sequence source from Legacy, eliminating our sequence mismatch issues during data validation. No more minus query discrepancies!

**Important Notes:**
- ALS setup must complete first before ENTITYDEV can proceed
- This is temporary for our validation phase - we'll remove it once testing is done
- Scripts include full rollback procedures if needed
- Comprehensive health checks and monitoring included

**Timeline:**
Could we target this for [day/time]? The implementation is straightforward but I'm available if you hit any snags.

Let me know if you have questions about the approach or need any clarification on the customization points.

Thanks!

P.S. - The scripts are pretty detailed with step-by-step instructions, but the main thing is just updating those connection details and sequence owner values before running.
