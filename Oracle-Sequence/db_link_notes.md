**Subject: Alternative Sequence Sync Solution - DB Link Approach**

Hi team,

After reviewing our sequence synchronization challenge, I wanted to propose a much simpler alternative that could solve our immediate problem while eliminating the GoldenGate complexity.

**The Simple Solution: Database Link**
Instead of replicating sequence values between systems, we could have ENTITYDEV call the Legacy TINSIDCNT sequence directly via database link. This means both systems would use the exact same sequence source, guaranteeing identical TIN_SID values with zero synchronization effort.

**Key Benefits:**
- Eliminates replication lag concerns Sam mentioned
- No ETL timing coordination needed  
- No GoldenGate configuration or maintenance
- Perfect data comparison results (100% sequence match)
- Implementation time: hours instead of weeks

**The Best Part:** Once we've validated that our modernized system produces identical results to Legacy, we can remove the database link entirely and return to independent sequences. This gives us the verification we need without permanent architectural dependencies.

**Trade-off:** ENTITYDEV would depend on Legacy network connectivity during the validation period, but this is temporary and much simpler than the GoldenGate approach.

This could be our "quick win" to get accurate data comparisons while we focus on other modernization priorities. Thoughts on exploring this path?

Let me know if you'd like me to prepare the technical details.

Best,
[Your name]
