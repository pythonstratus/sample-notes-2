Yes, absolutely! A DBA should be able to implement this easily. Here are the key additional details to include in your email to the DBA:

**Subject: DBA Request - Database Link Implementation for Sequence Synchronization**

Hi [DBA Name],

Could you help implement a database link solution for our TINSIDCNT sequence synchronization between Legacy (ALS) and ENTITYDEV? This would eliminate our current sequence mismatch issues during data validation.

**Implementation Request:**

**On Legacy (ALS):**
- Create dedicated user: `entitydev_link_user` 
- Grant: `CREATE SESSION`, `SELECT ON TINSIDCNT`
- Current TINSIDCNT value: ~254,223,193 (please verify current value)

**On ENTITYDEV:**
- Create database link: `als_sequence_link` connecting to Legacy
- Test connectivity and sequence access
- Backup current local TINSIDCNT sequence value
- Drop local TINSIDCNT sequence 
- Create synonym: `TINSIDCNT` pointing to `TINSIDCNT@als_sequence_link`

**Network Details Needed:**
- Legacy hostname/service name: [provide actual values]
- Port: 1521 (confirm)
- Network connectivity between systems during ETL window (3 AM)

**Validation:**
- Test that `SELECT TINSIDCNT.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL` works on ENTITYDEV
- Verify both systems now generate sequential values from same source

**Timeline:** This is for our data validation phase. Once modernization testing is complete (estimated [timeframe]), we can remove the database link and return to independent sequences.

**Rollback Plan:** Keep backup of current sequence values to restore if needed.

I have the complete technical scripts ready if helpful. This should be a straightforward 30-minute implementation.

Thanks!
[Your name]

**Additional considerations to mention:**
- **Security**: Minimal privileges (read-only sequence access)
- **Performance**: Network latency for sequence calls (typically negligible)
- **Availability**: ENTITYDEV dependent on Legacy connectivity during validation period
- **Temporary nature**: Emphasize this is for validation, not permanent architecture

The DBA will appreciate the clear scope and temporary nature of the request!
