# ETL Challenges Summary

## Core Issues
- **ETL Order Problem**: ETLs run sequentially but not in correct order (e.g., E3 runs before E5)
- **Test Synchronization Issues**: Tests run in random order instead of sequentially
  - Solution: Add test method order annotations
- **Code Not Synchronized**: System lacks proper sequential processing

## Error Handling Requirements
- If an extract fails mid-process, all tasks should terminate
- Email notifications should be triggered
- Source file issues (missing/corrupted) should stop the entire job
- Error details should be displayed in sustainment workbench

## Specific Data Issues
- **E3 Failure**: Failed due to DAT file issue
  - Same files ran successfully in Legacy system
  - Need to determine how Legacy handled these issues
- **S1 File**: Column length updated from 54/59 to 64
- **E5 Record Issue**: E5 record was incorrectly removed from log load table after E3 failure

## Job Status Problems
- System not writing to job status table for every job
- Query error: "not a valid month"
- Data type discrepancy in update statement

## Data Comparison Concerns
- Spreadsheet comparing pre/post weekly data shows discrepancies
- Need review before wider sharing

## Notification Strategy
- Planning to use Splunk for notifications instead of email
- Need comprehensive error logging for Splunk consumption

## Proposed Data Storage Solution
- Reconsidering materialized views due to archive space issues
- Parquet file with UI utility approach suggested as alternative
  - Better for tracking bug fix progression
  - Can be read quickly with JFreeChart reader

## Recap of Key Issues
1. **Extract Date Derivation**: Snapshot date needs to be derived from the dataset using the max function rather than using system date.
2. **Command-Line Parameters**: The hard-coded date requires enhancement to allow passing via command prompt for greater flexibility.
3. **Naming Convention Requirements**: Diane (not Dyne) expects "pre" and "post" prefixes for snapshot tables, which the current code doesn't properly handle.

## Next Steps
- Fix issues immediately (today and tomorrow morning)
- Create tickets for major bugs
- Share compiled meeting notes
