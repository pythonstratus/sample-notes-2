I understand you're not getting any results from the query. Let's break it down into smaller pieces to help debug where the issue might be. Here are some diagnostic queries you can run to identify the problem:

1. First, let's check if the `:roid` parameter value exists and is valid:

```sql
-- Check if the roid parameter value exists in the main tables
SELECT roid FROM assn WHERE roid = :roid;
SELECT roid FROM entmod WHERE roid = :roid;
```

2. Verify that the join conditions are returning data independently:

```sql
-- Check if the qskip table has any records with qskipind = 1
SELECT * FROM qskip WHERE qskipind = 1 LIMIT 10;

-- Check the relationship between tin values in assn and ent tables
SELECT a.tin, e.tin 
FROM assn a 
INNER JOIN ent e ON a.tin = e.tin
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;

-- Check if the modqueue table has records matching the roids
SELECT * FROM modqueue WHERE roid = :roid OR proid = :roid;
```

3. Simplify the main query by removing the complex CASE statements and formatting to isolate the core issue:

```sql
SELECT t.tin, t.roid, q.qtin, q.qskipind
FROM (
    SELECT tin, 
           TO_CHAR(a.area, 'FM09') || TO_CHAR(a.territory, 'FM09') ||
           TO_CHAR(a.grnum, 'FM09') || TO_CHAR(a.ronum, 'FM09') as roid
    FROM assn a
) t
INNER JOIN qskip q ON t.tin = q.qtin
WHERE q.qskipind = 1
AND t.roid = :roid;
```

4. Check if the formatted roid values in the assn table match your parameter value:

```sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(area, 'FM09') || TO_CHAR(territory, 'FM09') ||
    TO_CHAR(grnum, 'FM09') || TO_CHAR(ronum, 'FM09') as formatted_roid,
    roid
FROM assn
WHERE TO_CHAR(area, 'FM09') || TO_CHAR(territory, 'FM09') ||
      TO_CHAR(grnum, 'FM09') || TO_CHAR(ronum, 'FM09') = :roid
OR roid = :roid;
```

5. Check if the last join condition is causing the issue:

```sql
-- Check if the condition t.roid = m.proid is valid
-- This looks potentially problematic as you're joining roid to proid
SELECT a.roid, m.proid 
FROM assn a
INNER JOIN modqueue m ON a.roid = m.proid
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
```

6. Based on the query, verify if this condition is returning any data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM qskip q
INNER JOIN assn a ON q.qtin = a.tin
WHERE q.qskipind = 1
AND ROWNUM <= 10;
```

These diagnostic queries should help isolate which part of the query is filtering out all the rows. The most likely issues are:

1. The `:roid` parameter doesn't match any records
2. The `qskipind = 1` condition is filtering out all records
3. One of the join conditions isn't matching (particularly the modqueue join on t.roid = m.proid looks suspect)
4. The formatting logic for the roid is causing a mismatch

After running these queries, you should be able to pinpoint exactly where the issue is occurring.
