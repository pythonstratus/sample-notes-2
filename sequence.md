Yes, it's definitely possible to preserve sequence numbers when migrating from your legacy Oracle DB to the new one. Here are several approaches you can take in your Java ETL job:

## Option 1: Extract Current Sequence Values and Recreate
```sql
-- In legacy DB, get current sequence value
SELECT sequence_name, last_number 
FROM user_sequences 
WHERE sequence_name = 'YOUR_SEQUENCE_NAME';

-- In new DB, create sequence starting from that value
CREATE SEQUENCE new_sequence_name 
START WITH [extracted_last_number + 1]
INCREMENT BY 1;
```

## Option 2: Use CURRVAL/NEXTVAL During Migration
In your Java ETL code:
```java
// Get the current sequence value from legacy DB
String getCurrentSeqSQL = "SELECT your_sequence.CURRVAL FROM dual";
long currentSeqValue = // execute query

// Set the new sequence to start from the correct value
String alterSeqSQL = "ALTER SEQUENCE new_sequence RESTART START WITH " + (currentSeqValue + 1);
```

## Option 3: Migrate Data with Explicit IDs
Instead of relying on sequences during the ETL process:
```java
// Extract data with existing sequence values
String extractSQL = "SELECT id, other_columns FROM legacy_table";

// Insert into new DB with explicit ID values
String insertSQL = "INSERT INTO new_table (id, other_columns) VALUES (?, ?)";

// After migration, set sequence to max ID + 1
String updateSeqSQL = "SELECT setval('sequence_name', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM new_table))";
```

## Important Considerations:

**Sequence Gaps**: Oracle sequences can have gaps due to rollbacks, caching, or crashes. Decide whether you need to preserve these gaps or create a continuous sequence.

**Multiple Sequences**: If you have multiple sequences, you'll need to handle each one individually.

**Concurrency**: Ensure your ETL process handles sequence management atomically to avoid conflicts.

**Testing**: Always test with a subset of data first, especially the sequence recreation part.

The most reliable approach is usually Option 3 - migrating the actual ID values and then resetting the sequence to start from the highest migrated value. This preserves referential integrity and avoids any sequence synchronization issues during the migration process.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or help with specific implementation details for your Java ETL job?
