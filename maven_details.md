I noticed you're having trouble with Maven and JDK setup. Yes, it definitely matters which JDK you use with Maven, and I can help you get everything configured properly.

# Setting Up Maven with JDK 17

Based on your helpdesk's advice, Maven needs JDK 17 specifically. While either Oracle JDK or RedHat OpenJDK version 17 should work fine, you'll need to properly set up your environment variables:

## Setting JAVA_HOME

1. Locate your JDK installation directory
   - For Oracle JDK: Typically `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`
   - For RedHat OpenJDK: Typically `C:\Program Files\RedHat\java-17-openjdk`

2. Open Environment Variables:
   - Right-click on "This PC" → "Properties" → "Advanced system settings" → "Environment Variables"

3. Under "System variables", click "New"
   - Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
   - Variable value: Your JDK installation path
   - Click "OK"

## Setting MAVEN_HOME

1. Locate your Maven installation directory

2. Create a new system variable:
   - Variable name: `MAVEN_HOME`
   - Variable value: Your Maven installation path
   - Also create `M2_HOME` with the same value for compatibility

## Updating PATH Variable

1. Edit the PATH variable in system variables
2. Add these entries:
   - `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`
   - `%MAVEN_HOME%\bin`

## About the Missing .m2 Folder

The .m2 folder (Maven's local repository) is created when you first run a Maven command and is hidden by default in Windows. To resolve this:

1. Run `mvn --version` in a new Command Prompt to initialize Maven
2. Enable "Hidden items" in File Explorer's View tab to see the .m2 folder
3. Or try running `mvn help:system` to force repository creation

Either Oracle JDK 17 or RedHat OpenJDK 17 should work with Maven, but I'd recommend using whichever your organization standardizes on for consistency. Let me know if you need any clarification!
