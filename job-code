The old commits containing the file are completely removed from the new history.
	â€¢	When you git push --force, you overwrite the history on GitHub.
	â€¢	Other usersâ€™ local clones still have the old commits, but:
	â€¢	If they try to push, GitHub will reject it due to history divergence.
	â€¢	If they re-clone, theyâ€™ll only get the new, cleaned version.
	â€¢	To stay in sync, they must either:
	â€¢	Re-clone the repo.
	â€¢	Or manually delete their local history and align with the new version.

ðŸš¨ However:
	â€¢	If someone cloned or forked the repo before the purge, they still have a copy.
	â€¢	GitHub wonâ€™t serve the old commits after rewriting, but forks and cached clones elsewhere might.
	â€¢	To be as thorough as possible:
	â€¢	Delete any tags pointing to the bad commits.
	â€¢	Ask collaborators to delete or clean local clones.
	â€¢	If the data was pushed to GitHub, consider contacting GitHub Support for help in removing cached data (especially for credentials or secrets).

So in short: if done properly and fully, you effectively wipe the file from GitHub and future clones â€” but existing clones before the purge still need attention.
