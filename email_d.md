**Subject:** DialMenu Analysis Complete - Review Request

Hi Team,

We've completed our detailed analysis of the DialMenu system and have updated our documentation based on the stakeholder feedback from the June 17th meeting.

**What we've delivered:**
- Comprehensive system flowchart (Mermaid diagram)
- Detailed technical analysis report
- Production vs. legacy code discrepancy identification
- Modernization recommendations incorporating your simplification requirements

**Key updates based on your feedback:**
- Identified Steps 7 & 8 as non-existent in production
- Documented the actual load dial process in Step 2 (Dial2_crdata3)
- Captured requirements to eliminate intermediate file processing
- Outlined streamlined 6-step target workflow vs. current 10-step legacy process

**Next Steps:**
Please review the updated document when you have a chance. We'd like to schedule time to work with you on reviewing the actual production code and refining the modernization tasks based on your business priorities.

The analysis provides a solid foundation for the Java modernization effort while focusing on simplification rather than one-to-one legacy replication.

Let us know when you'd like to discuss next steps.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
