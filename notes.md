Perfect! Now I understand the full context. Based on this response from Santosh, here's what's happening:

## **The Real Validation Process:**

**Primary Method**: They validate TRANTRAIL by doing a **MINUS operation** after every Daily or Weekly load to ensure it **exactly matches Legacy**

**Secondary Method**: They have legacy sanity check scripts as backup validation

**Business Testing**: They want you to ask the business directly what specific data they want to test

## **Simple Email Response:**

**Subject: Re: TranTrail Analytics - Understanding the MINUS Validation Process**

Hi Santosh,

Thanks for clarifying the validation approach. I understand now - you're using MINUS operations after each load to ensure TRANTRAIL matches Legacy exactly, with the legacy sanity check scripts as secondary validation.

Got it on the business testing piece too. Since you mentioned I should ask the business directly about what data they want to test, I'll reach out to them to understand their specific validation requirements rather than making assumptions about the 300-400 record sampling.

The MINUS approach makes perfect sense for ensuring data integrity between systems. We'll align our analytics work to support this existing validation framework.

I'll coordinate with the business team on their testing needs and get back to you.

Thanks for the guidance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**Key Takeaway**: They already have a solid validation process (MINUS operations), and you were overthinking it with complex sampling strategies. The business team needs to specify what they actually want to test!
