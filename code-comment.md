Subject: Development Approach Summary - Implementation Steps from Code Review Meeting

Dear Dev Team,

Following our code review call with stakeholders, I'd like to summarize the agreed approach for our implementation, focusing on the development and QA processes (sections 3 onwards from our planning document).

## 3. Development Process

### 3.1 Backend Service Development
- 3.1.1 Backend service implementation should begin after requirements gathering
- 3.1.2 Unit testing for the backend service must be comprehensive, with particular attention to error handling as shown in the reference code (e.g., try-catch blocks for database operations)

### 3.2 UI Development (if needed)
- 3.2.1 UI and BE integration should follow our established patterns
- 3.2.2 Both UI components and integration points require unit testing

### Additional Documentation Requirements
- When reviewing legacy code (section 2.2), add comments directly to the legacy code such as procedures
- All comments should be formatted to support JavaDoc generation (using /** */ format)
- Follow the pattern in the reference code for method documentation (see @Override methods in the attached example)

## 4-7. Deployment and Assignment

- 4. Push code to GitHub following our branch naming convention (feature/EWM-XXXX-description)
- 4.1 Merge with DEV branch after peer review
- 5. Submit to QA for verification before deployment
- 6. Once verified by QA, mark as "Done"
- 7. Assignment to ALE Developer for final implementation

## Reference Implementation Notes

The reference code demonstrates several key patterns we should follow:
1. Proper error logging with descriptive messages
2. Database constraint handling with delete-before-insert pattern
3. Status tracking throughout job execution
4. Consistent transaction management
5. Clear method documentation that will generate into JavaDocs

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
