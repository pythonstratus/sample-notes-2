# Meeting Summary: Screen Misalignment Issues

## Key Takeaways

**Primary Issue**: There's a significant disconnect between what was developed and what was actually requested. Sarah has email documentation proving the current screen implementation doesn't meet their agreed-upon requirements.

**Critical Problems Identified**:
- Current system provides same or worse data visibility than legacy system
- Performance improvements were needed for large reports/queries, not view screens
- Core requirement was to display more columns together on one screen with stacked headers
- Search functionality is implemented incorrectly (should search cases, not sort fields)

**Data Visibility Concerns**: The team emphasized they are "all about data and seeing it" - the visual field, how data is displayed, and manipulation capabilities are fundamental requirements that aren't currently met.

## Immediate Action Items

**Security Priority**: Two links contain unsecured live taxpayer data (including real TINs) that must be secured immediately. Sharon needs to have Brian hide these columns right away.

**Process Actions**:
- Schedule working sessions to review wireframes and previous email feedback
- Review discrepancies between wireframes and current demonstration
- Remove current demonstration until more work is completed
- Set up call with Sarah before any executive presentations

## Technical Focus Areas

**Backend vs. Frontend**: The team's strength lies in backend logic and ETLs, but the UI isn't ready for director-level presentations. Need to focus on demonstrating actual performance improvements and differentiation from legacy systems.

**Data Integration**: While Avuse shows better end-to-end data integration with ATM data reading, case assignment integration is still in progress.

The meeting reveals a fundamental misalignment between delivered features and actual requirements, requiring immediate course correction before any executive showcases.
