  `body`: `Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for bringing the Windows dark mode compatibility issue to our attention. We've identified the root cause and have a clear plan to resolve this.

**Technical Details:**
The current interface uses fixed light-colored backgrounds and dark text, which creates poor contrast and readability issues when Windows is set to dark mode. Our application currently doesn't respond to the system's `prefers-color-scheme` media query, which is the standard way modern web applications detect and adapt to dark mode preferences.

**Our Solution:**
We will implement a comprehensive dark mode theme that includes:
- Automatic detection of Windows dark mode settings
- Dynamic color scheme switching using CSS custom properties
- Proper contrast ratios for accessibility compliance
- Consistent styling across all UI components including tables, forms, and navigation elements

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Week 1: Theme system architecture and color palette definition
- Week 2: Component-level dark mode implementation
- Week 3: Testing across different Windows versions and browsers
- Week 4: Deployment and final verification

**Testing Approach:**
We'll test the implementation across multiple scenarios including Windows 10/11 dark mode, various browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox), and ensure smooth transitions between light and dark themes.

This enhancement will not only resolve the compatibility issue but also provide a more modern, user-friendly experience that respects user preferences.

We'll keep you updated on our progress and will be ready to demonstrate the solution by [specific date]. Please let us know if you have any questions or specific requirements for the dark mode implementation.
