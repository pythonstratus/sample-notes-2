Based on this more detailed technical documentation, here's an improved breakdown for the QA team:

## Enhanced Test Strategy

### **System Context**
- **System**: ICS (Integrated Case System) Assignment Table
- **Components**: DIAL system, SIA (Standard IDRS Access System), ROI's ICS Inventory
- **Key Process**: Weekly case selection and assignment to groups with foreign addresses (zip 00000)

### **Detailed Business Rules to Test**

**1. Assignment Number Validation (AATTGG01)**
- Format must be exactly AATTGG01 
- Status must be "open" (not P-pending, not closed)
- No security lock present
- **Test Data Needed**: Groups with various AATTGG01 states

**2. Case Status Rules**
- S status cases: Can be deselected
- P status cases: Cannot be deselected  
- Accelerated cases: Cannot be deselected once selected
- **State Transitions**: P-Pending → S when sent to SIA → TSIGNED in IDRS

**3. Weekly Processing Timeline**
- **Cutoff**: Close of business Thursday
- **Selection Window**: Before applying to ICS
- **Upload Day**: Monday (Tuesday after Monday holiday)
- **Deselection Deadline**: Before Thursday cutoff

### **Critical Test Scenarios**

**Pre-Conditions Testing:**
```
TC001: Group has open AATTGG01 → Access granted
TC002: Group has locked AATTGG01 → Access denied
TC003: Group has no AATTGG01 → Access denied  
TC004: Group has closed AATTGG01 → Access denied
TC005: Multiple groups - mixed AATTGG01 states → Individual validation per group
```

**Case Selection/Deselection Logic:**
```
TC006: Deselect S status case → Success
TC007: Attempt deselect P status case → Error/Block
TC008: Attempt deselect Accelerated case after selection → Error/Block
TC009: Case transitions S→P during session → Deselection blocked mid-process
```

**Weekly Processing Integration:**
```
TC010: Select cases before Thursday cutoff → Success
TC011: Attempt selection after Thursday cutoff → Should be blocked
TC012: Upload to SIA on Monday → Status changes to P-Pending
TC013: Cases with foreign zip 00000 → Sent to ENTITY in DIAL
```

**API Integration (Frontend calling wiring API):**
```
TC014: Manager Control Merge/Update API call → Latest assignment data
TC015: API failure during selection → Error handling
TC016: Concurrent API calls → Data consistency
```

**Role-Based Access:**
```
TC017: Group Manager access with valid 01 → Full access
TC018: Acting Group Manager delegation to Secretary → Maintains responsibility
TC019: Group Secretary access without delegation → Appropriate restrictions
TC020: Revenue Officer access → Limited to assigned cases
```

### **Edge Cases & Error Scenarios**

**Timing-Based:**
- AATTGG01 becomes locked during active session
- Thursday cutoff reached mid-selection
- Monday holiday affecting Tuesday upload

**Data Integrity:**
- Duplicate AATTGG01 numbers
- Corrupted assignment table data
- SIA system unavailable during upload

**Concurrent Access:**
- Multiple users selecting from same group simultaneously
- Manager and delegated secretary working concurrently

### **Test Data Requirements**

**Groups Setup:**
- Groups with valid open AATTGG01
- Groups with locked AATTGG01  
- Groups with closed AATTGG01
- Groups missing AATTGG01
- Groups with multiple 01 assignments

**Cases Setup:**
- Cases in S status (deselectable)
- Cases in P status (non-deselectable) 
- Accelerated cases
- Cases with foreign zip 00000
- Cases in various IDRS statuses

**User Roles:**
- Group Managers
- Acting Group Managers  
- Group Secretaries
- Revenue Officers

### **Integration Points to Validate**
1. **ICS Assignment Table** ↔ **DIAL System**
2. **Frontend** ↔ **Wiring API** 
3. **SIA Upload Process** ↔ **IDRS System**
4. **Weekly Batch Processing** ↔ **ROI's ICS Inventory**
