I can elaborate on the database issues mentioned in the image with more technical context:

The text indicates you're experiencing significant resource constraints with your database environment, specifically:

1. **M7 Table Space Limitations**: When running queries against the M7 system (likely Oracle M7 or a similar database platform), you're hitting table space limitations. This means the allocated storage for tables has reached its limit, preventing proper data retrieval operations. The legacy nature of this system appears to be contributing to these space management problems.

2. **ExaData Archival Challenges**: The note highlights specific issues with Oracle Exadata's handling of archives:
   - When data is loaded into Exadata, creating snapshots of tables is triggering archive space issues
   - Archival storage is becoming overwhelmed during normal database operations (inserts/updates)
   - Test/development environments appear to be particularly affected by these limitations

3. **Potential Solutions Mentioned**:
   - Enabling auto-extension for M7 to dynamically manage space allocation as data volume grows
   - Finding a better archive management solution for Exadata, though the note cautions that clustering complicates this approach (likely because clustering affects how archive logs are generated and managed)

These issues suggest you're dealing with a complex Oracle ecosystem with capacity planning challenges across both the older M7 system and newer Exadata infrastructure. The problems appear to be affecting both production operations (queries hitting space limits) and administrative functions (archival management).

The root cause seems to be insufficient space allocation combined with potentially inefficient archival strategies, particularly when handling large data operations that generate significant archive logs.
