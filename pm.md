This is a complex enterprise system modernization involving:
✓ Technology migration from mainframe/shell to Java/Spring Boot
✓ 10-step sequential batch processing with inter-step dependencies
✓ Large-scale file processing (COMBO.raw latency issues)
✓ Multiple database operations with transactions and stored procedures
✓ Legacy system integration maintaining backward compatibility
✓ Production-critical requirements (zero downtime, audit, security)
✓ Multi-environment deployment with different configurations
✓ No existing documentation - requires reverse engineering
✓ Parallel SIA and ICS processing - multiple workstreams
✓ Enterprise Spring Batch framework implementation
This isn't a simple "lift and shift" - it's a comprehensive enterprise architecture transformation of mission-critical batch processing systems with 30+ years of embedded business logic.
