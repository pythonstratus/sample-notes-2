Based on your meeting notes, I can extract the core issue and potential solutions:

## **Core Issue**

The fundamental problem is **sequence synchronization mismatch** between Legacy (ALS) and Modernized (ENTITYDEV) systems during data verification:

1. **Legacy System**: Uses TINSIDCNT sequence to generate TIN_SID values during data inserts
2. **Modernized System**: Uses its own separate sequence in ENTITYDEV schema 
3. **Result**: Same business data gets different TIN_SID values in each system, causing verification failures

**Specific Impact**:
- Daily 3 AM job inserts new data with different sequence values on each system
- "Minus queries" (Legacy minus Modernized) show mismatches purely due to sequence differences
- Cascading effect: TIN_SID is used to generate other ID sets (AD_SET, TIME_SET, etc.), multiplying mismatches
- Prevents achieving expected "100% match" during testing

## **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue isn't just technicalâ€”it's architectural. You have two autonomous systems that both need to:
1. Generate new business data independently 
2. Produce identical results for verification
3. Use sequences that inherently create different values

## **Potential Solutions**

### **Option 1: True Sequence Replication (Your Document Approach)**
- Implement GoldenGate sequence replication as outlined in your document
- **Pros**: Keeps sequences synchronized automatically
- **Cons**: Complex setup, potential performance impact, may not solve autonomous operation issue

### **Option 2: Verification-Time Translation**
Instead of syncing sequences, create a mapping mechanism:
- Build a cross-reference table linking Legacy TIN_SID to Modernized TIN_SID values
- Modify verification queries to translate IDs before comparison
- **Pros**: Allows autonomous operation, simpler implementation
- **Cons**: Requires additional mapping logic

### **Option 3: Business Key Verification**
- Focus verification on business data rather than technical sequence values
- Compare using natural business keys instead of generated sequence IDs
- **Pros**: More meaningful verification, avoids sequence sync complexity
- **Cons**: May require query restructuring

### **Option 4: Controlled Sequence Sharing**
- Have Modernized system call Legacy sequence via database link for new inserts
- **Pros**: Ensures identical sequence values
- **Cons**: Creates dependency, potential performance/availability issues

## **Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Clarify verification requirements**: Do you need sequence values to match, or just business outcomes?
2. **Assess impact scope**: Which other tables beyond ENT are affected by TIN_SID cascading?
3. **Consider hybrid approach**: Sequence replication for verification environments, autonomous sequences for production

What's your preference for exploring these options further?
