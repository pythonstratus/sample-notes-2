Subject: Request to Install utPLSQL Unit Testing Framework

Hi DBA Team,

Could you please install utPLSQL in our Oracle database? It's an open-source unit testing framework that works great with Oracle databases and will help us improve our PL/SQL code quality through automated testing. With this package, we can develop a React framework that could be used to unit test our complex stored procedures.

This will help us test complex procedures like riskcalc(area) by:
• Automating test cases for different input scenarios and edge cases
• Validating calculation accuracy against expected results
• Testing error handling and boundary conditions
• Ensuring consistent results after code changes or deployments

Installation details:
- Download from: https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL
- Compatible with Oracle 11.2+
- Standard installation using provided scripts

If you need further information, you can check the website above. I can also help by sending SQL scripts for the installation if needed.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
