## Document Summary

This ETL Process Leadership Review Document presents three distinct architectural approaches for modernizing data processing from our Legacy Entity Exadata system to a modern Oracle database environment. The document covers:

- **Architecture 1:** ProC-based legacy system with direct database operations and file logging
- **Architecture 2:** Modern Java ETL with comprehensive GoldenGate validation and monitoring
- **Architecture 3:** Custom validation framework without GoldenGate dependencies

Each approach offers different levels of complexity, validation capabilities, and operational requirements to support various organizational needs and infrastructure constraints.

**Note:** This document represents an **initial final draft** of our ETL architecture analysis. We will continue to review and make changes as needed based on stakeholder feedback, technical evaluations, and evolving business requirements.
