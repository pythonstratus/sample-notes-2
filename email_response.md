Thank you for the clarification on the Phase 2.3 requirements and iteration planning. I appreciate you taking the time to outline the prioritization approach.

You're absolutely right about the importance of Phase 2.3, and I apologize for any confusion. After reviewing your breakdown:

**For Phase 2.3 - RiskCalc and Combo_Risk Reconstruction:**
- I understand these need to be rebuilt with a wrapper for parallel processing capability
- This aligns with our performance optimization findings where we identified that parallel processing could significantly improve execution times
- We'll ensure proper collection areas meet the iteration 1 requirements

**Regarding the Prioritization Approach:**
I think the targeted prioritization makes excellent sense given the workload distribution:
- ICS Weekly and ICS Daily as foundational priorities
- DIAL Weekly (Case Assignment) in the first iteration
- Addressing other processes based on their priority levels

This phased approach allows us to deliver value incrementally while managing risk appropriately.

On a lighter note, I completely understand about catching up on sleep - it's amazing how a good night's rest can bring clarity to complex problems and boost creative problem-solving! I've found some of my best architectural solutions come after proper rest.

**Next Steps:**
1. We'll focus on the Phase 2.3 wrapper implementation for RiskCalc parallel processing
2. Continue with the prioritized ETL iterations as outlined
3. Keep monitoring performance improvements from our current optimizations

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are specific aspects of the RiskCalc wrapper you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,
