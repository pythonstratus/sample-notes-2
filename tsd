Core Concept
The system is designed to ensure revenue officers maintain an appropriate caseload ("inventory") that:

Allows efficient case resolution
Considers officer grade level and expertise
Adjusts based on individual circumstances
Follows standard inventory ranges for different grade levels

Breakdown of Tasks/Modules for Developers
1. User Authentication & Role Management Module

Implement ENTITY user authentication
Define user roles (revenue officers, managers, trainees)
Link users to appropriate inventory ranges based on grade level

2. Inventory Range Configuration Module

Implement standard inventory ranges by grade level:

Grade 13: 1334-50
Grade 12: 34-50
Grade 11: 53-79
Grade 9: 59-69
Grade 5/7: 49-59


Configure grade-specific rules (e.g., Grade 13 case mix of 60% Grade 13 cases, 40% lower-grade cases)

3. Case Assignment Engine

Implement case assignment logic with 5-case weekly assignment limit
Create exceptions handling for special circumstances
Develop trainee-specific assignment rules linked to OJT milestones
Implement prioritization logic for case assignments

4. BEARS Integration Module

Create interface for BEARS request submission
Implement trainee record creation in ICS
Manage coach assignment functionality
Handle position type designation

5. Inventory Monitoring & Alerts Module

Create dashboard showing current inventory vs. standard range
Implement alerts for inventory exceeding maximum levels
Track 10-day remediation period for excessive inventory
Generate notification documentation for employee EPF

6. Workload Balancing Module

Implement options for handling excess inventory:

Reassignment to ICS GM hold file
Detailing to additional officers
Group boundary adjustments
Queue return functionality


Create workflow for special case types that can't be moved to queue

7. Reporting & Analytics Module

Generate End of Month Balanced Measures reports
Exclude trainees from inventory adjustment calculations
Track inventory trends and compliance with standards
Support Collection Consultation sessions

8. Documentation & Audit Module

Maintain documentation of inventory adjustments
Track NFTL determinations and ICS history notations
Monitor CSED expiration timelines
Document trust fund case handling

Elements Needing Clarity

System Integration: The document references multiple systems (BEARS, ICS, ICS GM hold file) but doesn't clarify how they interact. Developers need API specifications and data exchange formats.
Business Rules Specificity: What exactly constitutes "developmental needs," "performance issues," or "complex casework" for inventory adjustments? These subjective terms need clear definitions.
Approval Workflows: The document doesn't specify approval workflows for inventory adjustments. Who approves reassignments or queue returns?
Data Fields: Specific data fields needed for each case type are not defined.
Timeframe Definitions: Terms like "accelerated issuance" need precise definitions.
User Interface Requirements: No specifications on how users will interact with the system.
Security Requirements: No mention of security protocols for handling taxpayer data.
Reporting Requirements: Detailed specifications for End of Month Balanced Measures reports are missing.
Territory Manager Concurrence: The process for obtaining territory manager approval for reassignments needs clarification.
System Notifications: Specifics about how the system should notify users of inventory issues are not defined.
