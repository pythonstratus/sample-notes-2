**Subject: Request for Disaster Recovery Documentation - Legacy Java Modernization Project**

Dear [Agency Leadership/IT Operations Team],

I hope this email finds you well. Our team is currently working on the legacy Java modernization project, where we have successfully deployed containerized jobs to the ECP (Enterprise Container Platform) environment running as scheduled cron jobs.

**Background:**
As part of our client engagement, we've been asked to provide details about our disaster recovery capabilities and procedures. Since our application components are deployed as containers within the agency's managed ECP infrastructure, we recognize that the primary disaster recovery mechanisms are likely implemented at the platform and infrastructure level rather than at our application layer.

**Request:**
Could you please provide us with documentation or details regarding the existing disaster recovery plans that cover:

1. **Infrastructure-level DR:**
   - ECP platform backup and recovery procedures
   - Geographic redundancy and failover capabilities
   - Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

2. **Data Protection:**
   - Database backup strategies and retention policies
   - Cross-region data replication (if applicable)
   - Point-in-time recovery capabilities

3. **Container Platform Resilience:**
   - Container orchestration failover mechanisms
   - Persistent volume backup and recovery
   - Configuration and secrets management in DR scenarios

4. **Network and Connectivity:**
   - Network failover procedures
   - DNS and load balancer configurations during DR events

5. **Operational Procedures:**
   - DR activation procedures and decision criteria
   - Communication protocols during DR events
   - Testing schedules and validation procedures

**Our Application Context:**
Our containerized jobs are stateless by design and can be redeployed from our CI/CD pipeline. However, we want to ensure we can accurately represent the overall system resilience to our client, including both the infrastructure capabilities you provide and any application-level considerations we should address.

This information will help us provide a comprehensive response to our client regarding the overall disaster recovery posture of the modernized system.

Thank you for your time and assistance. Please let me know if you need any additional context about our deployment architecture or if there's a specific point of contact who handles DR documentation requests.

Best regards,
