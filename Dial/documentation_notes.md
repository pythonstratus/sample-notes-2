**Subject: Enhanced Entity Dial Batch Deployment Guide**

Hi Diane and Samuel,

I've created an enhanced version of the Entity Dial Batch deployment guide to help our stakeholders better understand the deployment and execution process.

The updated document includes:
- Prerequisites and access requirements
- Detailed step-by-step instructions with explanations
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- CronJob schedule examples
- Verification checklist
- Best practices and glossary

This should help reduce confusion and questions about the deployment process. Please review when you have a chance and let me know if you'd like any adjustments.

The document is attached.

Thanks,
[Your name]
