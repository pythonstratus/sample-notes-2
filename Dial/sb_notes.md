**Subject: Questions on SBSE Table Population and DPQSIND Field Discrepancy**

**To:** Samuel

**CC:** [Your team as needed]

Hi Samuel,

I'm reaching out regarding two issues I've identified while analyzing the legacy dial code that need clarification:

## 1. SBSE Table Population Issue

We've discovered that the SBSC/SVAC TDI table is not being populated correctly, causing downstream failures in our ETL process. 

**Current situation:**
- The code expects to find data in the SBSC table to seed updates for dial ENT
- SBSC table is currently empty in our environment, causing all updates to fail
- We found that 15,000 records were copied from Legacy to SBSC initially
- The program is supposed to update the seed number, but we need to understand the source

**Questions:**
- What process or application is responsible for initially populating SVAC TDI/SBSC in Legacy?
- Should these tables be synced weekly from Legacy? If so, what's the mechanism?
- Is this something that should be handled through Goldengate replication?

## 2. DPQSIND Field Discrepancy (Position 607)

I've identified a data discrepancy in the DP6Q variable that's causing inconsistencies between our database and Legacy.

**The problem:**
- **Position 607 in our database records:** Shows value of "1" for all records
- **Position 607 in Tanjita's data file:** Shows value of "1" for all records  
- **Position 607 in Legacy:** Shows space (empty) for the same records
- This affects approximately 6 million records

**Questions:**
- Why is Legacy storing a space instead of "1" in the 607th position?
- Which is the correct/authoritative value - the "1" or the space?
- Should we be converting the space to "1" during our data migration, or preserving the Legacy format?

Please let me know if you need any additional context or if we should set up a call to walk through these issues together.

Thanks,
[Your name]

Would you like me to adjust anything else?
