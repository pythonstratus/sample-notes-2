**Subject: Stored Procedure Performance Optimization - LOAD_COREDIAL**

**Summary of Changes:**

We've refactored the LOAD_COREDIAL procedure to dramatically improve performance for our 15 million row data loads.

**Key Differences:**

**OLD Approach:**
- Used a cursor with BULK COLLECT to process data in batches
- Row-by-row processing with FORALL loops
- Exception handling for each duplicate row
- Sequential execution
- **Estimated runtime: 2-4 hours**

**NEW Approach:**
- Single set-based INSERT-SELECT statement (no cursor)
- Parallel execution (16 parallel processes on Exadata)
- Direct-path insert with APPEND hint
- Proactive deduplication using ROW_NUMBER() window function
- Exadata Smart Scan optimizations enabled
- **Estimated runtime: 10-30 minutes**

**Performance Improvement: 5-20x faster**

**Technical Changes:**
- Eliminated cursor and bulk collect loops
- Added parallel DML settings (PARALLEL 16)
- Implemented efficient deduplication at query level
- Enabled Exadata-specific optimizations
- Maintained all business logic and calculations

**Next Steps:**
- Test in development environment
- Monitor performance metrics
- Adjust parallel degree if needed based on system load
