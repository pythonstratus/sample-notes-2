I've carefully reviewed all the images of the code you shared. This appears to be a program called "ent_assn_pend.pc" which is a case assignment management system that handles pending cases and cases on hold/skip status.

Looking at the code, I can extract the SQL portions that are used for retrieving data for hold and skip functionality. Here's the SQL script based on the code I can see:

```sql
-- SQL script for Hold and Skip functionality extracted from ent_assn_pend.pc

-- Initial SQL connection setup
EXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA;

-- Main query for retrieving pending or hold/skipdate cases
-- This is constructed dynamically in the code based on conditions
SELECT ROWNUM, %s %s
FROM %s
WHERE ( (STATUS = 'O' AND PROID BETWEEN %d AND %d)
       OR STATUS = 'O' AND ROID = %d)
       %s
       AND 0 < (SELECT /* index(assn assn_tin_ix) */ 
                count(*) 
                FROM ASSN 
                WHERE ASSN.TIN = %s.TIN
                AND ASSN.FS  = %s.TINFS
                AND ASSN.TT  = %s.TINTT
                AND QPICKIND in (%s)
                AND (AREA = %d AND TERRITORY = %d)
                %s)
       AND GRNUM = %d
ORDER BY %s;

-- Cursor-based processing for the dynamic query
EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOTFOUND DO sqlError(w->entscreen);
EXEC SQL PREPARE SEARCH_PREP FROM :dynamicSql;
EXEC SQL DECLARE SEARCH_CUR CURSOR FOR SEARCH_PREP;
EXEC SQL OPEN SEARCH_CUR;

-- Fetch loop
EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOTFOUND DO break;
EXEC SQL FETCH SEARCH_CUR INTO :gmBuff;

-- Close cursor
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR DO sqlError(w->entscreen);
EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOTFOUND DO sqlError(w->entscreen);
EXEC SQL CLOSE SEARCH_CUR;

-- Additional SQL conditional clauses generated by the code:
-- For international cases (if G_INTERNATIONAL[0] == 'Y')
"OR STATUS = 'Q' AND PROID = 35000000 AND ZIPCODE = 00000"
"OR STATUS = 'Q' AND PROID = 35000000 AND CITY IN ('APO', 'DPO', 'FPO')"
"OR AREA = 35 AND TERRITORY = 62"

-- Sort clauses (based on selected sort field)
-- Various sorting options including ARANK, MODELRANK desc
```

This SQL script retrieves cases based on their status ('O' for open cases) and various filtering conditions including:
1. PROID and ROID (likely profile IDs and record IDs)
2. Area and territory codes
3. Case assignment data from the ASSN table
4. Filter conditions for QPICKIND (which determines pending or hold/skip status)

The system toggles between different views (VIEWING_TIN and VIEWING_BAL) and uses dynamically constructed SQL to retrieve the appropriate case data based on user selection (F4-PEND or F9-HOLD/SKIPDATE).


Yes, this SQL script appears to be the correct implementation for the hold and skip functionality that was referenced in the code you previously shared. This SQL is more complete and detailed than what I was able to extract from the program code.

Let me analyze this SQL script:

```sql
select t.skip_date,
       (case t.qpickind
            when 1 then 'H'
            when 2 then 'K'
            else ''
        end) as queue_indicator,
       t.assignment_number,
       t.zip,
       m.proid as zip_aligns_to,
       t.tin,
       t.priority_alpha,
       (case e.caseind
            when 'C' then 'Combo'
            when 'A' then 'TDA'
            when 'I' then 'TDI'
            when 'F' then 'FTD'
            when 'O' then 'OI'
            when 'P' then 'Other (RCP)'
            else 'Other'
        end) as case_type,
       t.grade,
       e.tp as taxpayer_name,
       em.balance as balance_due
from(
    select assnque as skip_date,
           tin,
           qpickind,
           zip,
           rank || arisk as priority_alpha,
           ro_gl as grade,
           TO_CHAR(a.area, 'FM09') || TO_CHAR(a.territory, 'FM09')
                                   || TO_CHAR(a.grnum, 'FM09')
                                   || TO_CHAR(a.ronum, 'FM09')
           as roid,
           (case when TO_CHAR(a.grnum, 'FM09') || TO_CHAR(a.ronum, 'FM09') = '7000'
                then 'Queue'
                when TO_CHAR(a.ronum, 'FM09') = '00' then 'Hold File'
                else TO_CHAR(a.area, 'FM09') || TO_CHAR(a.territory, 'FM09')
                                             || TO_CHAR(a.grnum, 'FM09')
                                             || TO_CHAR(a.ronum, 'FM09')
            end) as assignment_number from assn a) t
inner join (select tinsid, tin, tp, street, city, state, zipcde, tinfs, caseind from ent) e
on t.tin = e.tin
inner join (select emodsid, roid, balance from entmod) em
on t.roid = em.roid
inner join (select roid, proid from modqueue) m
on t.roid = m.proid
inner join qskip q
on t.tin = q.qtin
where q.qskipind = 1
and t.roid = :roid
```

This SQL query is designed to get information about cases that are on hold or have been skipped. It:

1. Retrieves case information from multiple tables (assn, ent, entmod, modqueue, qskip)
2. Formats various numeric codes with the TO_CHAR function
3. Uses CASE statements to translate codes into meaningful descriptions:
   - Queue indicators (H, K) based on qpickind
   - Case types (Combo, TDA, TDI, etc.) based on caseind
   - Assignment numbers based on group and record numbers

The query focuses on cases where qskipind = 1 (which appears to be the flag for skipped cases) and matches the provided roid parameter.

This appears to be the complete SQL script for the hold and skip functionality that you were looking for, and it matches with the logic I was seeing in the procedural code from your previous images.
