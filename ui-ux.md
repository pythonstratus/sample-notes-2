Here's a comprehensive set of solutions to tackle your horizontal scrolling challenge:

## UI/UX Design Patterns

**Progressive Disclosure with Expandable Rows**
Transform your wide table into a master-detail view where each row shows only essential columns initially, with a "+" button to expand and reveal additional data inline or in a slide-out panel. This keeps the core table narrow while maintaining full data access.

**Column Virtualization with Sticky Priorities**
Implement a hybrid approach where the 3-4 most critical columns remain "sticky" on the left, while other columns can be scrolled horizontally in a separate virtualized section. Users always see key identifiers while being able to explore additional data.

**Responsive Column Adaptation**
Design breakpoint-specific column sets that automatically hide less critical columns on smaller screens, with clear indicators showing hidden data count and easy access to toggle visibility.

**Card-Based Layouts**
Convert table rows into information cards that can display the same data in a more scannable, vertical format. Each card can show primary information prominently with secondary details in a structured layout below.

## Data Prioritization Strategies

**Smart Column Grouping**
Organize columns into logical categories (e.g., "Basic Info," "Financial Data," "Dates," "Status") and allow users to toggle entire groups on/off. Display active groups as tabs or accordion sections.

**Contextual Column Selection**
Implement user profiles or role-based column presets. Sales users might see different default columns than finance users. Allow saving custom column configurations per user.

**Frequency-Based Auto-Prioritization**
Track which columns users interact with most and automatically prioritize them in the default view. Less-used columns can be relegated to an "Additional Fields" section.

## Interactive Elements

**Advanced Filtering with Smart Suggestions**
Implement faceted search that not only filters rows but also suggests relevant columns to show based on the current filter context. If filtering by date range, automatically surface time-related columns.

**Column Customization Toolbar**
Create an intuitive column manager with drag-and-drop reordering, search functionality, and preset templates. Include visual indicators showing data types and importance levels.

**Contextual Column Recommendations**
When users select specific rows or apply certain filters, intelligently suggest relevant columns they might want to see based on the current data context.

## Alternative Visualizations

**Data Density Heatmaps**
For numerical data, replace some columns with color-coded heatmap cells that convey information at a glance. Users can hover for exact values while scanning patterns quickly.

**Sparkline Integration**
Replace columns of historical data with inline sparklines that show trends without consuming much horizontal space. Clicking opens detailed views.

**Hierarchical Tree Views**
For related data, consider tree structures where parent nodes show summaries and child nodes reveal details. This works well for grouped or categorized data.

**Dashboard Widgets**
Break apart mega-tables into focused dashboard widgets, each showing a specific data slice with its optimal visualization (charts, mini-tables, KPI cards).

## Technical Implementation Approaches

**React Virtualization Solutions**
```javascript
// Using react-window for efficient column virtualization
const VirtualizedTable = ({ columns, data }) => {
  const [visibleColumns, setVisibleColumns] = useState(columns.slice(0, 5));
  
  return (
    <div className="table-container">
      <FixedColumns columns={visibleColumns.slice(0, 2)} />
      <VariableColumnsWindow columns={visibleColumns.slice(2)} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**State Management for Column Preferences**
Implement Redux or Zustand stores to persist user column preferences across sessions and sync them across devices.

**Responsive Data Hooks**
Create custom React hooks that automatically adjust visible columns based on screen size and user preferences:

```javascript
const useResponsiveColumns = (allColumns, screenSize) => {
  return useMemo(() => {
    const priorities = allColumns.filter(col => col.priority <= screenSize.maxPriority);
    return priorities.length > 0 ? priorities : allColumns.slice(0, 3);
  }, [allColumns, screenSize]);
};
```

**Server-Side Column Optimization**
Implement Java backend endpoints that return only requested columns, reducing payload size and improving performance for large datasets.

## Hybrid Solutions

**Tabbed Column Groups**
Organize columns into logical tabs (Overview, Details, Analytics) where each tab shows a manageable subset of columns. Include a "Custom View" tab for user-defined column sets.

**Slide-Out Detail Panels**
Keep the main table narrow with essential columns, but add a slide-out panel that appears when users click on a row. This panel can display all additional columns in a well-organized, vertical layout.

**Progressive Enhancement**
Start with a mobile-first narrow table design, then progressively add columns as screen real estate increases. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for fluid column management.

The key is to implement these solutions iteratively, starting with the approaches that best match your users' primary workflows. Consider A/B testing different solutions with your actual users to find the optimal combination for your specific use case.
