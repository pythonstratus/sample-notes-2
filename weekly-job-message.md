**Subject: Weekly ETL Jobs Status Update - Action Required**

Dear [Stakeholder Name],

I'm writing to provide an update on our ETL implementation progress. Our team has been actively working on the Weekly Jobs since completing the Java code development. While our code is fully compliant with the procedure standards, we've encountered several database-related challenges during testing that are impacting our timeline.

Specifically, we're finding that the Weekly ETL jobs interact with dependencies in the Oracle DB environment that are not entirely reliable. Multiple tables show inconsistencies when comparing source data with snapshots, and we're experiencing recurring audit trail errors that block testing completion. There are also several cross-schema dependencies with the ALS schema that need careful review.

**Recommendation:** We suggest proceeding with the Daily jobs implementation while we continue addressing the Weekly jobs issues. We need to audit each table that the Weekly process touches to identify and resolve any cross-schema dependencies.

I've attached a detailed technical analysis document that includes proof points to showcase these issues. We will work with you to find a resolution to these challenges and ensure both Weekly and Daily ETL jobs function correctly.

We look forward to discussing this further in our meeting tomorrow.

Please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
