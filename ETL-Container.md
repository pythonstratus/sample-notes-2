This technical summary covers an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) deployment discussion with several key architectural and operational considerations:

## Deployment Architecture Options

**Primary Deployment Approaches:**
1. **Standalone JAR Deployment**: Independent application requiring complete infrastructure setup including certificates, host configuration, and resource allocation
2. **Integrated Entity Service Deployment**: Leveraging existing entity service infrastructure with embedded Spring scheduler for runtime configuration flexibility

## Resource Management and Infrastructure

**Kubernetes Resource Constraints:**
- Current resource quota limitations affecting pod stability
- AWS CLI and COPS configurations consuming 4GB CPU memory
- IRS (Infrastructure Resource Request) ticket submission required for quota increases
- Recommended 50% buffer above current resource requirements to account for pod termination overhead

**Container Orchestration:**
- OpenShift deployment environment with PVC (Persistent Volume Claims) and S3 bucket integration
- File system mounts already configured for entity service at `/eftu/entity/incoming` path
- Application properties externalized from JAR for runtime configuration flexibility

## Scheduling and Job Execution

**Scheduling Mechanisms:**
- **Legacy Cron Jobs**: External scheduling with complete application lifecycle per execution
- **Spring Scheduler**: Programmatic scheduling within running application context
- **Administrative UI**: Proposed checkbox interface for daily/weekly job configuration with time inputs

**Batch Processing Architecture:**
- Spring Batch framework implementation with six sequential job execution pipeline
- Current unit test execution environment incompatible with production deployment
- Controller endpoint required for on-demand job triggering in deployed environment

## Data Pipeline and File Management

**File Processing Flow:**
1. S3 bucket (`EMTU entity incoming`) serves as source repository
2. Cron job downloads files to local directory structure (`/cd/EFTU/DD/incoming`)
3. ETL processes files (E1, E2, E73, E5) with copy vs. move operation considerations
4. Database operations require coordination with table truncation and index rebuilding

**AWS CLI Integration:**
- Pod-based AWS CLI access for bucket operations
- Environmental variable configuration for authentication
- Command-line interface for manual file management and verification

## CI/CD and Deployment Pipeline

**Build and Deployment Strategy:**
- GitHub integration with develop branch (currently using revamped branch)
- ECP (Enterprise Container Platform) image configuration
- Multiple deployment options: single JAR with dual deployment types or separate application builds
- YAML configuration files for cron job definitions within CI/CD pipeline

**Configuration Management:**
- External application properties for runtime configuration
- Profile-based configuration for different environments (dev, pre-prod, prod)
- Database vs. property file approaches for dynamic scheduling configuration

## Technical Challenges and Constraints

**Environment Compatibility:**
- Sandbox environment configuration incompatible with production deployment
- IDE debug mode with pre-configured profiles not translatable to containerized environment
- Container execution limitations for current JAR configuration

**Operational Considerations:**
- Manual JUnit test triggering incompatible with automated deployment
- Service endpoint development required for programmatic job execution
- Resource quota management across multiple environments with varying deployment timelines

The discussion reveals a complex system requiring careful consideration of resource management, scheduling flexibility, and deployment architecture to achieve the goal of operational ETL service deployment by early next week.
