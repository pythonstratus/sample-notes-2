I'll break down the key tasks and action items from these meeting notes:

## Immediate Tasks (Today/Tomorrow)

**Ranjitha:**
- Audit ETL functions, field names, and table names based on Sam's input
- Finalize and share the spreadsheet with proposed changes for each function
- Prepare list of TINs (Tax Identification Numbers) for data comparison
- Have the function list ready by tonight or first thing tomorrow morning

**Sam:**
- Complete the Databricks reference architecture today (before leaving in 2 hours)
- Share the reference architecture for team review
- Summarize the meeting and share within 30 minutes
- Review architecture if available in the next 2 hours before departure

**Christina:**
- Complete the prod refresh (estimated 2-4 hours)
- Notify Golden Gate group once refresh is complete

**Paul:**
- Review Ranjitha's spreadsheet
- Work with Ranjitha and Eddie on split-specific TINs for Sarah

## Medium-term Tasks (This Week)

**Team (while Sam/Diane are away):**
- Validate historical runs thoroughly
- Compare data between PROD and dev environments
- Provide 4-5 examples showing data differences
- Identify TINs where prod differs from xdata but matches dev legacy
- No legacy database changes until Sam/Diane return

**Samuel:**
- Reach out to Brian for clarification on timing
- Contact Sarah and Eric to reconfirm testing availability
- Discuss contingency plans if changes need to be reverted

**Martha:**
- Ensure systems are in sync after refresh
- Run comparison queries using the TIN list

## Strategic/Planning Tasks

**Business Validation:**
- Present cases to business team comparing old vs new transcc data
- Get business sign-off on ETL function changes
- Address validation concerns with business team

**Data Analysis:**
- Compare post-snapshot to prod using TINs
- Identify affected functions with non-deterministic ordering
- Document examples where legacy data produces inconsistent results

**Coordination:**
- Schedule discussions with Sarah, Eric, and Brian about next steps
- Plan for dev environment changes after refresh completion
- Coordinate timing around team availability (considering Sam/Diane's absence)

## Key Dependencies

- Refresh completion before making any changes
- Brian's approval for timing of changes
- Business team sign-off on validation approach
- Sam and Diane's return for final implementation

The main focus seems to be on validating ETL function changes while managing business concerns about data integrity, with careful timing around key team members' availability.
