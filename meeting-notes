ETL Testing Project Executive Summary
Current Status

The ETL testing project is experiencing significant challenges after two months of effort with limited progress beyond rudimentary unit testing
A comprehensive testing approach has now been outlined by Diane but execution has stalled due to implementation issues
Key problems include ETL processes not running in the required sequential order (E3, E5, E8) and improper use of database snapshots

Testing Methodology

Process: Compare legacy system to new system using database snapshots

Take pre-snapshots of legacy database
Load snapshots into modern environment tables
Run ETL processes with matching date parameters
Compare post-snapshots to verify data integrity


Data Sources: Daily input files (positional flat text files, not CSVs) from ICS system
Validation Requirements: Both count and row-level data accuracy

Critical Priorities

Implement the three-step verification process:

Copy pre-snapshots into exadata tables
Run ETL processes in correct sequence
Compare results against post-snapshots to Diane's spreadsheet on IRS SP site


Begin populating the test tracking spreadsheet with legacy and new database counts
Implement proper error handling (atomic transactions with rollback capability)
Add validation rules for special cases (S1 changes, E6 monthly processing)

Action Plan

Team is taking a "hawkish approach" with minimum two meetings daily to accelerate progress
Developing a web-based testing solution deployable to local Kubernetes/OpenShift environment
Debugging has begun with Paul leading technical implementation
Snapshot table naming conventions being standardized by Ranjita

Next Steps

Santosh will treat Diane's approach as "gospel" and implement with accuracy
Team will present updated approach within 1-2 days
Continuous feedback loop established with Diane to refine testing strategy
Focus on getting successful test runs before implementing detailed validations

Key Team Members

Diane: Project oversight and testing methodology
Santosh: Implementation lead
Paul, Ranjita, Ravi: Technical implementation and support
RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.


Legacy ETL Job Process Description
I have a legacy ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) job that processes a series of RAW DAT files on different schedules:
Current Process

The job runs on both Daily and Weekly schedules
For the Daily schedule, the process runs multiple components in sequence (e.g., E5 runs first, then E3)
Each component processes specific RAW DAT files
The system currently uses an "all or nothing" approach to transactions
When one component fails (e.g., E3), the entire job rolls back, including any previously successful components (like E5)
