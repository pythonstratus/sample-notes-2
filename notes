Here are the rewritten questions organized by topic for your stakeholder meetings:

## **Case Management & Status Tracking**

**1. Case Queue Workflow**
- "When a case is completed and leaves the active queue, what status should it show in the system?"
- "How do you distinguish between cases that are temporarily on hold versus permanently closed?"
- "What information do managers need to track case progress and bottlenecks?"

**2. Case Assignment Process**
- "When a case gets reassigned from one person/team to another, what assignment history needs to be preserved?"
- "How do you currently determine who is responsible for handling a specific case?"
- "What should happen in the system when organizational territories or team structures change?"

## **Data Management & Reporting**

**3. Reference Numbers & Identification**
- "How do you currently use the different reference numbers (queue numbers vs. RO numbers) in your daily work?"
- "What's the business purpose of having separate tracking numbers, and how should they relate to each other?"
- "When do you need to look up cases by different identifier types?"

**4. Assignment History & Tracking**
- "When someone new takes over a case, what background information do they need about previous assignments?"
- "How do you currently track which cases have been reassigned and why?"
- "What reports do you need about case assignments and workload distribution?"

## **System Integration & Process Flow**

**5. Cross-System Updates**
- "When assignment information changes, which other systems or processes need to be automatically updated?"
- "How do you ensure that assignment changes don't create gaps in case coverage?"
- "What manual workarounds are you currently using that we should automate?"

## **Business Impact & Requirements**

**6. Pain Points & Success Criteria**
- "What are the biggest challenges with the current case assignment process?"
- "How would you measure whether the new system is working effectively?"
- "What would happen to your business operations if case assignments weren't tracked properly?"

**These questions focus on business value rather than technical implementation, making them more accessible for stakeholder discussions while still gathering the technical requirements you need.**
