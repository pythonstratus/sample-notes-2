**Subject: Proposal for Dedicated ETL Pod Deployment for ENTITY Service**

Hi Team,

Following our ETL deployment discussion on May 23rd, I wanted to propose that implementing a dedicated pod for the ENTITY ETL process would be the optimal approach for our deployment strategy.

**Key Benefits of Dedicated Pod Architecture:**

**Resource Isolation & Stability**
- Eliminates resource contention issues currently affecting our existing pods
- Provides dedicated CPU and memory allocation (4GB) without impacting other services
- Allows for independent scaling based on ETL workload requirements

**Operational Flexibility**
- Enables independent deployment cycles without affecting the main entity service
- Supports both scheduled (cron-based) and on-demand execution models
- Facilitates easier troubleshooting and monitoring of ETL-specific processes

**Infrastructure Alignment**
- Leverages existing PVC mounts and S3 bucket configurations
- Maintains access to `/eftu/entity/incoming` file system structure
- Utilizes established AWS CLI integration for bucket operations

**Deployment Efficiency**
- Reduces complexity of integrating Spring Batch jobs into existing entity service
- Eliminates need for extensive modifications to current entity service deployment
- Supports our CI/CD pipeline with dedicated ETL image configuration

**Scheduling Capabilities**
- Accommodates both daily and weekly processing requirements
- Allows for future expansion to monthly or custom scheduling patterns
- Provides clean separation between ETL timing and entity service operations

Given our resource quota constraints and the need to have the ETL service operational by Tuesday/Wednesday, a dedicated pod approach would streamline our deployment while maintaining system stability. This aligns with Chinmay's feedback about avoiding the complexity of embedding ETL functionality within the existing entity service.

I recommend we proceed with the IRS ticket for resource quota increase and configure the dedicated ETL pod deployment. This approach positions us well for the demonstration to Diane while establishing a robust, scalable ETL pipeline.

Please let me know your thoughts, and I'm happy to discuss implementation details further.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
