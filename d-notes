  `body`: `Hi Team,

I appreciate the discussion around Oracle synonyms and understand the perspective shared. While I recognize the potential benefits of eliminating synonyms during our modernization effort, I'd like to propose a more measured approach given our current context.

**Current State & Risk Assessment:**
- We're successfully meeting our ETL performance expectations and timelines
- Our mission-critical financial data requires maximum stability during modernization
- The Spring Boot and batch processing implementation is progressing well

**Recommended Strategy:**

Rather than making immediate changes to synonyms, I suggest we implement a phased approach:

1. **Discovery & Documentation Phase**
   - Conduct comprehensive audit of existing synonym usage across all systems
   - Interview stakeholders to understand business dependencies
   - Map synonym chains and identify critical data flows

2. **Risk Assessment & Planning**
   - Analyze impact on current ETL processes
   - Identify low-risk synonyms for initial elimination
   - Develop rollback strategies for each change

3. **Gradual Implementation**
   - Start with non-critical synonyms in development environments
   - Implement changes during planned maintenance windows
   - Monitor performance impacts before proceeding

**Rationale:**
Given that we're handling mission-critical financial data and currently meeting our performance targets, introducing synonym changes without proper analysis could introduce unnecessary risk to our modernization timeline and system stability.

I recommend we schedule a follow-up discussion with Samuel and the team to present this phased approach, ensuring we maintain our current momentum while planning for systematic improvements.

Thoughts on this approach?
