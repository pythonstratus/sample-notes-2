Hi Ranjita,

Thanks for your assistance with the job processing implementation. I wanted to provide you with a comprehensive update on our progress:

We've successfully implemented synchronous execution for the Daily Jobs, ensuring each job fully completes before the next one begins. The key improvements include:

1. Synchronization Strategy:
   - Implemented CompletableFuture with blocking join() calls to ensure sequential execution
   - Added proper exception handling at multiple levels to capture and log detailed error information
   - Established a clear execution order for interdependent job processes (E5 → E3 → E8 → E7 → E8)

2. Transaction Management:
   - Added transaction boundary controls to ensure atomicity of each job
   - Implemented automatic rollback mechanisms that trigger when exceptions occur
   - Enhanced exception propagation to ensure failed jobs don't affect subsequent executions

3. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Improved notification system with detailed logging at each stage of job execution
   - Added comprehensive error reporting with contextual information about job failures
   - Implemented job completion tracking to provide visibility into the process lifecycle

I've applied the same synchronization pattern to the Weekly jobs and testing is proceeding well. Additionally, I'm working on decoupling the codebase from IDE dependencies to enable standalone execution.

The UI development is also progressing - this will provide a dashboard where users can trigger jobs and monitor real-time execution output on screen.

I'll be dedicating the rest of today and tonight to finalize these implementations. I'll keep you updated on our progress.

Thanks,
Isiam
