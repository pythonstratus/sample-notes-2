# Technical Summary: Database Management and System Integration Challenges

## User Creation and Role Management
- The `setup_als_roles` procedure efficiently creates a role and assigns permissions once, avoiding redundant execution
- Role-based approach allows dynamic expansion of table permissions after user creation via `GRANT` statements to the role
- Regular ALS users lack sufficient privileges to execute `setup_als_roles`; requires DBA-level access

## Data Naming Conventions and Extraction
- Daily tables follow "four three" naming pattern
- Weekly extracts dated by snapshot day (Sunday)
- Extract dates in log load must match the extract date from source systems
- E6 weekly files delivered at sprint end, month end, on Sundays
- Issue with "330" files lacking proper naming conventions
- Extract date should reflect the date of data extraction, not processing date

## Exadata Infrastructure Issues
- Connection problems due to full archive logs (Error 00257)
- System frozen state affecting database operations

## Transaction Management Implementation
- Added synchronization strategy to ensure sequential task execution with dependencies
- Implemented proper exception handling with SL4J for detailed error logging
- Transaction boundary controls ensure atomicity with automatic rollback mechanisms
- JDK version compatibility enables these transaction control improvements

## Golden Gate Replication Strategy
- Preferred method for schema replication over custom Java code
- Proposed naming convention: `[schema_name]_legacy_replica` (e.g., `als_legacy_replica`)
- Three target schemas identified: "als", "entity", and "dial" (correction: "entity" not needed)
- Schema creation requires elevated permissions (Peter/Jordan/Christina)
- Open questions about Goldengate's ability to replicate entire schema objects and special permission requirements

## UI Monitoring and Error Handling
- UI-based job monitoring code has been baselined
- Testing reveals issues with record management in log load during sequential job execution
- Enhanced error logging planned to track individual job outcomes

## Materialized Views and Recovery Strategy
- Materialized views considered for snapshot rollback functionality
- Conditional setup implemented for failure scenarios
- Discussion needed about traditional transaction rollback options

## Action Items
1. Fix table naming conventions by end of day
2. Send clear instructions on naming conventions to Ravi
3. Compile and test UI-based monitoring approach
4. Create new schema for Golden Gate replication to prevent overwriting
5. Confirm permissions for Matthew to replicate schema
6. Ask Matthew about Goldengate's full schema replication capabilities
7. Create `als_legacy_replica` and `dial_legacy_replica` schemas

This technical architecture addresses database user management, data synchronization, error handling, and system integration across legacy and modernized components.
