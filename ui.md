I've thoroughly reviewed all the screenshots you provided of the UI design and notes for an Entity Access system. Let me create a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the implementation approach and then provide detailed notes on the best way to implement this logic.

# Implementation Approach - Entity Access System

After analyzing the provided screenshots, I've identified the core logic needed to implement this Entity Access system. Here are my recommendations:

## Key Components & Implementation Strategy

### 1. User Authentication & Routing Logic

- The system uses both SEID and ROID to determine which screen to display after login: Staff Screen or General User Screen
- Implement a service layer that checks these credentials and routes users appropriately
- Include authentication modules that verify user identity and retrieve their access level data

### 2. Access Level Hierarchy

- Implement a hierarchical structure for ELEVELs (0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Each ELEVEL determines what access options are available:
  - ELEVEL 0: National staff with full access
  - ELEVEL 7: Acting Group Managers with special dual access (Group/Employee)
  - ELEVEL 2, 4, 6, 8: Standard general users with various territory-based permissions

### 3. Conditional UI Rendering

- Create a stateful UI component system that:
  1. Displays the appropriate screen based on user type
  2. Renders different access selection UI based on the number of access options a user has:
     - No dropdown for single access users
     - Dropdown with all options for multiple access users
     - Special dual-option dropdown for ELEVEL 7 users
  3. Changes the main menu options based on selected access type

### 4. Staff Access Implementation

- Staff screen requires a multi-step selection process:
  1. Level selection (National, Area, Territory, Group, Employee)
  2. Assignment Number selection
  3. Org/Function selection (not available for National level)
- Implement cascading dropdowns where each selection affects the options in subsequent dropdowns

### 5. Data Storage & State Management

- Implement a state management system to:
  - Store user's ELEVEL and access rights
  - Maintain selected access throughout the session
  - Persist default selections when users check "Keep Selection as Default"
  - Handle switching between different access types

### 6. Session Management

- Include a mechanism to detect when users need to change access levels
- Implement "Change Access" functionality that allows users to switch between their authorized levels without requiring re-login

## Technical Recommendations

1. **Frontend Architecture**:
   - Use component-based architecture with clear separation of UI components and business logic
   - Implement state management (Redux, Context API or similar) to manage complex state transitions

2. **Backend Services**:
   - Create APIs that provide user access information and valid assignment numbers
   - Implement validation logic on the server to prevent unauthorized access attempts

3. **Data Flow**:
   - User authentication → Retrieve access rights → Display appropriate screen → Process access selection → Load main menu with proper permissions

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Include clear error messages for invalid access attempts
   - Implement proper validation at each selection step

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Ensure access level checks are performed both client-side and server-side
   - Implement proper authorization checks for all API calls

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

1. **Complex Access Logic**:
   - Solution: Create a dedicated Access Control Service that encapsulates all access validation logic

2. **Maintaining State Across Multiple Screens**:
   - Solution: Use a centralized state management approach that persists user selections

3. **ELEVEL 7 Special Case**:
   - Solution: Implement special conditional logic for ELEVEL 7 users who need both employee and group access options

4. **Staff vs General User Screen Differences**:
   - Solution: Create base components that can be extended with specific functionality for each user type

This approach ensures a maintainable and scalable implementation that can handle the complex access control requirements of the system while providing a clear and intuitive user experience.
