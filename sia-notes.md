Based on my analysis of the shell script, here are the input files being used:

## Primary Input Files:

1. **`.stepck` file**
   - **Location**: `$DIALDIR/.stepck` (which is `/als-ALS/app/execlog/d.dial/.stepck`)
   - **Purpose**: Contains a status indicator (0 or non-zero) that determines if DIALS processing is complete
   - **Usage**: The script reads this file to check if it can proceed with processing

2. **`Slaextract.rpt` file**
   - **Location**: `$RUNRPT` which is `$DBPATH/Slaextract.rpt`
   - **Purpose**: Report file that gets written to throughout the process
   - **Usage**: Both input (for reading) and output (for appending)

3. **`alsent.$scnum.$x` files**
   - **Location**: `$DBPATH/$i/alsent.$scnum.$x` where:
     - `$i` = directory codes (15, 5C2, etc.)
     - `$scnum` = extracted code number (characters 3-4 of the directory name)
     - `$x` = current date in YYYYMMDD format
   - **Example**: `/als-ALS/app/entity/d.case/5C2/alsent.C2.20250528`
   - **Purpose**: These are the SIA (diagnostic/data) files that need to be backed up
   - **Usage**: Checked for existence, then copied to backup location

## External Programs/Scripts Used as Input:

1. **`$DIALDIR/Slaextract`**
   - **Location**: `/als-ALS/app/execlog/d.dial/Slaextract`
   - **Purpose**: External program that generates the SIA files
   - **Usage**: Executed to create the alsent files

## Directory Structure Expected:
```
/als-ALS/app/
├── entity/d.case/          ($DBPATH)
│   ├── 15/                 (area code directories)
│   │   └── alsent.15.YYYYMMDD
│   ├── 5C2/
│   │   └── alsent.C2.YYYYMMDD
│   └── Slaextract.rpt
├── execlog/d.dial/         ($DIALDIR)
│   ├── .stepck             (status file)
│   └── Slaextract          (executable)
└── dataload/d.case/        ($BACKUPDIR)
    └── [area codes]/d.BACKUPS/
```

## Summary:
The script primarily reads:
1. A status indicator file (`.stepck`)
2. Processes dynamically named data files (`alsent.*.*`)
3. Executes an external program (`Slaextract`)
4. Maintains a report file throughout execution

The script doesn't process the content of the `alsent` files - it simply checks for their existence and copies them to backup locations.
