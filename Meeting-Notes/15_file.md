Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

I wanted to update you that we have now verified the files and folder for .15 are available. We are currently investigating the root cause of why this file was missing initially, and I will add this to my to-do list to get back to you with our findings.

Regarding the DIAL testing, we did confirm during our code walkthrough that we are checking if the file exists before proceeding with the process.

I am currently compiling the meeting notes from our DIAL meeting yesterday and will share them with you soon. Thank you for your valuable feedback during the session.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
