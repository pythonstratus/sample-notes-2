# Email to Sarah - Area Dependencies Question

**Subject:** ETL Performance Optimization - Area Processing Dependencies Clarification Needed

Hi Sarah,

Hope you're doing well. Following up from our ETL call yesterday (Sept 16), we're working on performance optimizations for our data processing pipeline and need your business expertise on a critical question.

**Current Approach:**
We're currently processing areas individually (e.g., Area 11, Area 12, Area 13, etc.) with area-to-area conversions during database insertion (like converting 11 to A1).

**Proposed Optimization:**
We're considering processing everything into a single file and loading it directly into dial int to improve performance, given that we successfully processed 237 million records in 3 minutes during our recent testing.

**Key Question:**
Are there any business dependencies between areas that would prevent us from processing all areas together in a single batch? Specifically:
- Do any areas rely on data or processing results from other areas?
- Are there any sequencing requirements (like Area 35 needing to be processed last on the dial side)?
- Would consolidating all area processing into one operation impact any downstream business processes?

This change could significantly improve our ETL performance, but we want to ensure we don't break any existing business logic or dependencies.

Could we schedule a brief call this week to discuss this, or would you prefer to provide your input via email?

Thanks for your time and expertise on this.

Best regards,
[Your name]




Hi Sam,

Thanks for the heads up and for reaching out to Sarah directly. You're absolutely right that any discussion about changes to the DIAL processing should involve Sarah from the beginning.

I appreciate you framing this as a question about dependencies rather than optimization - that's much more collaborative and focuses on understanding the business requirements rather than suggesting improvements are needed.

The key questions you've outlined are exactly what we need clarity on:
• Area processing dependencies and sequencing requirements
• Impact on downstream business processes  
• Any business logic that relies on the current area-by-area approach

Should we wait for Sarah's response before proceeding, or would it be helpful to set up a brief call with all three of us to discuss this together? I'm flexible on timing and approach.

Thanks again for your thoughtful handling of this.
