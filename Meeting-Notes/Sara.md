Understanding the Challenge
You're absolutely right that we need to consider the legacy systemâ€”it contains valuable business logic and decades of institutional knowledge. However, the legacy Pro*C codebase presents unique modernization challenges that go beyond simple code translation:
Why Direct Translation Isn't Optimal

Architectural Paradigm Differences: ProC embeds SQL directly into C code with tight procedural coupling to Oracle databases. Modern Java applications use layered architectures (presentation, business logic, data access) with ORM frameworks, dependency injection, and design patterns that don't exist in ProC.
Database Interaction Models: Pro*C uses embedded SQL with cursor management and direct Oracle API calls. Java best practices employ JPA/Hibernate, connection pooling, and database-agnostic abstractions. A line-by-line conversion would produce unmaintainable, non-idiomatic Java code.
Memory and Transaction Management: Pro*C handles memory and transactions at a low level. Java uses garbage collection and declarative transaction management that fundamentally changes how we structure code.
Error Handling and Control Flow: Pro*C relies on C-style error codes and goto statements, while Java uses exception hierarchies and structured error handling.

Our Approach
We are referencing the legacy system, but we're doing logic migration, not code translation:

Business Logic Extraction: Understanding what the Pro*C code does (business rules, workflows, calculations)
Functional Equivalence: Ensuring the Java implementation produces the same business outcomes
Modern Implementation: Rebuilding using Java best practices, maintainability standards, and scalable architecture

Moving Forward
To address your concerns more effectively, could we:

Schedule a walkthrough showing how specific legacy modules map to our Java implementation?
Document our analysis process for key legacy components?
Establish clearer checkpoints for validating functional equivalence?

We're committed to preserving the business value in the legacy system while delivering a maintainable, modern solution. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.
