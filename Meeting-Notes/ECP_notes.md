Hi team,

Following up on our meeting today regarding the ECP namespace migration project. Here's a summary of where we stand and next steps:

**Current Status**

The basic infrastructure for separating the ALS namespace from entity is complete. The entity service and UI have been deployed, though detail jobs remain on the ALS namespace. The namespace has sufficient storage and resource quotas, and most ETL jobs only need to connect to S3 buckets for data downloads and configurations.

**Bucket Configuration**

Islam is working on getting approval for a new bucket request. The ALS bucket will be configured for the entity to upload and download data, with storage remaining on the entity side. Based on previous EFT to integration work (which took six weeks last time), we're hoping for a quicker turnaround this time.

**Migration Approach**

Once the bucket is approved, we'll:
- Terminate cron jobs on the ALS namespace
- Update bucket references in the entity to download from the new entity bucket
- Test the download process with a pilot scenario before migrating all jobs
- Maintain the ability to point to old ALS entity buckets during transition

**Pilot Migration - Kamal's CA Job**

We've identified Kamal's CA job as the first migration candidate. This job uses the CIETL common framework and pulls files from the responses folder (the inbound location). Kamal will push files to the new ECP namespace for testing purposes.

**SIA File Status**

The SIA job will be completely stopped on ALS once we're ready to migrate. We're currently in simulation mode and not yet dependent on real files from the EFT bucket. The folder structure follows: entity > dial > sia > correct accruals/case selections > responses.

**Action Items**

1. Islam to follow up on bucket approval timeline
2. Chinmay to continue testing current setup and prepare for file pushing to new namespace
3. Check with CR team about file posting processes
4. Create multiple tracking stories (CI ETL, D ETL, etc.) instead of one consolidated story
5. Add notes to stories indicating ETL portion coverage while bucket transition remains pending

**Timeline Note**

We're still awaiting confirmation on whether files can be sent simultaneously to both ALS and entity buckets during the transition period.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any of these points.
