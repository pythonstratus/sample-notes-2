Based on our comparison analysis, our modern ETL jobs have demonstrated reliable data consistency between EXADATA development and production environments over several weeks of execution. All entity counts match exactly across both servers - from small datasets like ORG (62 records) to large volumes like ENTACT (6+ million records) - totaling 17,887,000 records processed identically without any discrepancies. This achievement validates that our modern software development techniques and platform has delivered a robust, scalable data pipeline that eliminates data inconsistency risks and provides end users with confidence in data. The consistent execution across multiple entity types proves our development processes accurately replicate production conditions, this demonstrates operational excellence and validating our testing methodologies for critical business operations.
