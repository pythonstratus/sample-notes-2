Looking at your images, I can see the issue clearly. You have a parameter mismatch problem with the ICSASSIGN function between your Legacy and DIALDEV environments.

**The Problem:**
- Your Legacy environment has ICSASSIGN with 4 parameters
- Your DIALDEV environment has ICSASSIGN with 3 parameters  
- When procedures from Legacy (expecting 4 parameters) try to call the 3-parameter version in DIALDEV, you get compilation errors

**The Root Cause:**
The ICSASSIGN function signature was changed between environments, but the calling procedures weren't updated to match. This creates a mismatch where:
- Legacy procedures call: `ICSASSIGN(param1, param2, param3, param4)`
- DIALDEV function expects: `ICSASSIGN(param1, param2, param3)`

**Potential Solutions:**

1. **Create Two Function Versions (Recommended):**
   - Keep the existing 3-parameter ICSASSIGN function as is
   - Create a new 4-parameter wrapper function (e.g., ICSASSIGN_legacy) that calls the 3-parameter version internally
   - This maintains backward compatibility

2. **Communication with Sam:**
   Before making changes, I'd recommend the meeting/email approach mentioned in your notes. Ask Sam:
   - Which procedures are actively being used in production?
   - Is there a reason the 4th parameter was removed?
   - What's the preferred approach for handling legacy calls?

3. **Function Overloading:**
   If your database supports it, create an overloaded version of ICSASSIGN that accepts both 3 and 4 parameters.

The cleanest solution is probably option 1 - create a 4-parameter wrapper that internally calls your current 3-parameter function, ignoring or handling the extra parameter appropriately. This way you don't break existing functionality while supporting legacy procedures.
