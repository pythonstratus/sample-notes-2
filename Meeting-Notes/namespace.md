  `body`: `Hi Diane and Samuel,

Please review the following technical summary of our namespace migration plan and provide your approval to proceed.

**MIGRATION SCOPE & TIMELINE**
- Target: Weekly Files Area 2 (web application, CY application, cron jobs)
- Estimated duration: 4-5 weeks minimum
- Two-phase approach recommended

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

*Infrastructure Changes:*
- New S3 bucket creation (requires early EMT team coordination for dev, AQT, pre-prod, throttle environments)
- PVC sharing workaround needed (new mount creation required)
- Storage initially remains in ALS namespace
- New hostnames for route-based web applications must be added to TLA certificates (major activity)

*Configuration Updates:*
- SSO rules reconfiguration (particularly for entity)
- Splunk configuration updates
- CD/CDs deprecation requires buffer period for manual deployment if disabled mid-migration

**IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**

*Phase 1 (Few days):*
- Cron jobs migration to new namespace
- No HTTPS requirements
- Can proceed quickly

*Phase 2 (Extended timeline):*
- Web application migration
- Full configuration implementation
- Entity web application PVC sharing resolution

**IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**
- HTTPS certificate request for new namespaces (Santosh coordinating with product owner)
- Current/future state documentation (Chinmaye posting to Teams)
- Pipeline namespace configuration (end of next week target)
- Resource quota confirmation (existing allocation applies to new namespace)

**DEPENDENCIES**
- Certificate creation (product owner group selection issue needs resolution)
- EMT team early notification for S3 setup
- Pipeline team availability for namespace switching
- Diamond involvement required

**RISK MITIGATION**
- Parallel work streams where possible
- Snapshot of ALS configuration to be shared with Tyne
- Manual deployment buffer if CD/CDs disabled during migration

Please confirm approval to proceed with this migration plan and the proposed timeline.
