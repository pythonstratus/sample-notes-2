Hi Rick,
Thank you for catching this - you're absolutely right. We have a significant gap in our sprint plan.
The Core Issue: Missing System Testing Resources
Our capacity table shows only developers (Paul, Kamal, Ganga, Thomas, Bryan, Santosh - 396 hours total), but we're planning to complete system testing this sprint. We failed to include Ravi and Ranjita's capacity in the plan.
Here's the corrected breakdown:
System Testing Allocation:
For SIA Workbench UI (Ravi):

Story 1750497 (Splunk/Login Testing): 20 hours system testing
Story 1750498 (Email/Notifications Testing): 20 hours system testing
Story 1653354 (Q Flag Validation): 6 hours system testing
Story 1755681 (Record Count Display): 2 hours system testing
Total: 48 hours for Ravi

For ETL DIAL Case Assignments (Ranjita):

DIAL ETL Pipeline Testing: 40 hours system testing
DIAL Validation & Error Management: 20 hours system testing
Total: 60 hours for Ranjita

For Case Assignment UI & Case View UI (Ranjita supporting):

Various Bryan/Thomas UI stories: 12 hours system testing
Total: 12 hours additional

Revised Work Distribution:
Developers (Development + Unit Testing):

Kamal: 42 hours dev + 18 hours unit testing = 60 hours
Paul: 36 hours dev + 24 hours unit testing = 60 hours
Ganga: 32 hours dev + 32 hours unit testing = 64 hours
Bryan: 28 hours dev + 10 hours unit testing = 38 hours
Thomas: 48 hours dev + 18 hours unit testing = 66 hours
Santosh: 20 hours documentation + 8 hours unit testing + 32 hours scrum master activities = 60 hours

Testers (System Testing):

Ravi: 48 hours system testing (SIA Workbench UI)
Ranjita: 72 hours system testing (DIAL + Case Assignment UI + Case View UI)

This addresses your specific concerns:

✅ SIA Workbench UI: Kamal doing dev/unit test (60 hrs) + Ravi doing system test (48 hrs)
✅ ETL DIAL: Paul/Ganga/Santosh doing dev/unit test (144 hrs) + Ranjita doing system test (60 hrs)
✅ All capacity accounted for: 540 hours total planned work

Regarding the 400 vs 253 hours discrepancy you mentioned:

Are we showing 540 hours total effort to the client but only 253 billable hours after removing overhead/meetings/etc.?
Or is there another calculation I'm missing?

Next Steps:

I'll update the sprint plan with Ravi and Ranjita's system testing hours clearly broken out
I'll create the detailed phase breakdown spreadsheet showing dev/unit/system/peer review hours per story
Can we schedule 30 minutes tomorrow to review the updated plan before client presentation?

Does this address your concerns correctly now?
Thanks,
