**Response to Samuel:**

Yes, the ICS ETLs do include comprehensive error management for missing, corrupted, and other file-related issues. Here's how the error handling works:

**Current Process Flow:**
The system follows a structured approach with built-in error checks at multiple stages:

1. **File Download & Archive Process:**
   - Files are first downloaded via `cornjob etfu-entity-download-from-bucket` and `etfu-entity-weekly-download-from-bucket`
   - Archive jobs (`ics-etl-batch-archive-daily` and `ics-etl-batch-archive-weekly`) then archive the files

2. **File Restoration with Error Handling:**
   - Before processing, the system attempts to restore files from archive using `ics-etl-batch-daily` and `ics-etl-batch-weekly`
   - **Missing File Check:** The restore process first checks if target files exist in the archive folder
   - **File Corruption Handling:** If files exist, the system cleans files in `/eftu/entity/ics/current_extracts` and restores the file
   - **Failure Management:** If restoration fails, the process stops and shows "restore failed" - preventing downstream jobs from running with bad data

3. **Extract Date Validation:**
   - The system performs extract date checks in both `WeeklyLoadCheckService` and `DailyLoadCheckService`
   - **Date Mismatch Detection:** If the extract date is wrong, daily and weekly jobs will stop running
   - **Content Validation:** The system validates file content including field formats (checking for expected data types like numbers vs letters)

4. **File Content Error Management:**
   - **Format Validation:** If file content has incorrect formats (e.g., letters where numbers are expected), the file load will throw an error and jobs stop
   - **Line Length Checks:** The system handles varying line lengths (e.g., S1 files with 53-character lines vs loadS1.ctl expecting 61-character lines)
   - **Null Handling:** Non-satisfied validation parts are set as null, allowing processing to continue where possible

**Error Prevention Logic:**
The missing file checks in `WeeklyLoadCheckService` and `DailyLoadCheckService` will not work properly only if the restore process has issues but daily/weekly jobs still trigger (which the current logic prevents from happening).

This multi-layered approach ensures that corrupted, missing, or malformed files are caught before they can cause downstream processing issues.
