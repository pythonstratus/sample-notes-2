Hi Samuel,

I'm reaching out to request your help with some data discrepancies we discussed in today's meeting. Here's a summary of the key issues:

**Main Issues Identified:**

1. **Unmatching Records**: We have 700+ records that aren't working correctly due to logic implementation differences between our code and the database. The rect code logic (returns 3 if code is 5, returns 1 if code is 0) matches the SQL load dial function, but only a subset of records are affected.

2. **Date Calculation Problem**: We're seeing incorrect dates displayed (1986 instead of expected values). When calculations result in 0,00, the code returns 11900 per legacy logic. We're unable to locate where the 1986 date is originating from, and the system defaults to end of month when no date exists.

3. **Data Source Logic**: The data comes from a text file, reading 132 characters and using \"make dt\" to create dates. We suspect there may be code that hasn't been shared, as the \"make dt\" function returns dates but not in 00 format.

4. **Key Matching Issue**: The key we're creating doesn't match the legacy system. We need the core team code to generate the unique key properly. Treatment records with different entity types are causing query mismatches.

5. **Logic Discrepancies**: There are inconsistencies in how we're handling blank values (we're putting \"three\" for blank while legacy has \"one\", and another case where they have \"three\" and we have \"two\").

**Current Status:**
- Two issues remain unresolved
- The core logic is not changing (if space, then it's a two)
- We need your input to move forward

Could we schedule time to discuss this today? I'd like to propose 2 o'clock if that works for your schedule.

Thanks for your help with this!
