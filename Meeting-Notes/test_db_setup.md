Hi Christina and Samuel,

I wanted to follow up on the database setup request for the ENTITY user/schema on the TEST environment.

To clarify the replication request: we need to copy all database objects (tables, views, procedures, etc.) and data from the ENTITYDEV schema in the DEV database to the new ENTITY schema in the TEST database on Oracle/Exadata.

Christina, to address your question about the approach - you have a couple of options:
1. Use Oracle Data Pump to export from ENTITYDEV and import to ENTITY
2. Create the ENTITY user first (using the provided SQL), then replicate the objects and data

The SQL code provided should create the ENTITY user with the necessary permissions. Please review it and let me know if you need any modifications or have questions about the grants and tablespace assignments.

Once we have the user created, we can proceed with the data and object replication. Would you prefer to use Data Pump for this, or do you have another preferred method?

Please let me know if you need any clarification or if there are additional requirements for this setup.

Best regards,
