I've put together a developer summary for the End of Month Processing feature based on Sara's notes from our October 14th meeting (attached/below).
Key Point - Need Your Input:
There's an important nuance we need to address around data persistence. Sara mentioned that "the information cannot be stored" regarding the weekly review workflow. However, the system needs to track which weeks users have reviewed to enable/disable buttons and enforce the sequential approval process.
I've outlined three possible approaches in the summary:

Session-based state (backend)
React component state (frontend only)
Temporary database table with auto-cleanup

My recommendation is Option 2 (React state) since we only need to track the workflow during the active session - we're not creating a historical record of the click-through process, just enforcing that users review all weeks before completing.
However, I want to make sure we're interpreting Sara's constraint correctly. Does "cannot be stored" mean:

No database persistence during the workflow?
No historical audit trail of the review process?
Something else entirely?

Please review the attached summary and let me know your thoughts on the best approach given our technical constraints and Sara's requirements.
Next Steps:

Review technical summary
Clarify data persistence requirements
Confirm approach before Thursday's design review

Happy to discuss further - just let me know!
