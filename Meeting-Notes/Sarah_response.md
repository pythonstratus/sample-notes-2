Hi Sarah,

Thank you for the detailed explanation about the sorting issues in the ENTITY views. I want to make sure we fully understand the requirements so we can implement the correct solution.

A few clarifying questions:

**Legacy System Behavior:**
1. In the legacy system that's working well for you, what is the default sorting order when you first open the Module Management view? Is it TIN → MFT → Period, or a different sequence?
2. Are users currently able to perform any additional sorting in legacy while maintaining those background sorts, or does legacy prevent user sorting entirely?

**Expected User Experience:**
3. In the new system, should users be able to sort by other columns (like dates, assignment numbers, etc.) while still preserving the TIN/MFT/Period grouping structure?
4. Or would you prefer that these three sorts are completely locked and users cannot override them?

**Technical Implementation:**
5. When you mention "invisible sorts" - should these appear in the UI somewhere (like a sort indicator), or should they remain completely hidden from users?
6. For the data formatting issues you mentioned (like date formats), do you have documentation of the expected formats, or should we match exactly what legacy displays?

**Layout/Report Builder:**
7. Regarding the "Layouts" functionality - is this the same as the legacy "Report Builder" feature? Can you clarify what specific actions this dropdown should enable?

Understanding these details will help us ensure the sorting behavior matches your operational needs while providing the right level of user control.

Thanks,
[Your name]
