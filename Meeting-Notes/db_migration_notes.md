  `body`: `Hi Samuel,

Today I had a call with Brandon and to fast track our discussion here is the outcome I have prepared that will help us in our 4 PM call.

**Schema Changes Overview:**
Brandon confirmed that extensive table modifications were made to XE, LS, LD, and LA tables as part of the ALS modernization effort. The schema was completely redesigned per Jordan's requirements for improved readability and maintainability.

**Key Technical Findings:**

**Database Access Setup:**
- Schema: \"Also\" (not \"ALS\" - legacy naming)
- Brandon is providing environment file with JDBC connection details
- Spring profiles active, dev database connection uncommented
- Username/password credentials will be shared via secure chat
- Toad configuration: Enable \"save password\" checkbox for persistent connections

**Table Mapping Strategy:**
- No direct spreadsheet mapping exists between old/new tables
- Mapping preserved in column comments within Also schema
- Access via: Table → Columns/Indexes → Table Comments dropdown
- Legacy mapping codes maintained in `legacy_mapped_code` columns

**Critical Table Transformations:**
1. **LS → lean_summary**: Core parent table, 1:1 mapping with renamed columns
2. **LD**: Normalized with new `tax_module_id` primary key, proper FK relationships
3. **LA → lead_continuation_link**: 3 columns (original_slid, link_slid, continuation_code)
4. **XE → home_sl_taxpayer**: Taxpayer information table

**Normalization Impact:**
- Reference tables (e.g., lean_status_ref) converted from character codes to sequential IDs
- Foreign key constraints properly implemented
- Legacy character values preserved in `legacy_mapped_code` columns for migration tracking

**ETL Risk Assessment:**
Brandon highlighted potential ETL job disruption due to schema changes on ALS side. Primary dependencies identified:
- LA Table
- XE Table  
- LS Table
- LD Table

**Immediate Action Items for 4 PM Call:**
1. Discuss ETL job continuity strategy
2. Review schema change timeline and coordination
3. Address embedded issues from E2 procedure code review (January)
4. Confirm training schedule dependencies

**Query Example for Reference:**
```sql
-- Legacy: SELECT * FROM LS WHERE lsstat = 'A'
-- Modern: SELECT * FROM lean_summary ls 
--         JOIN lean_status_ref lsr ON ls.lean_status = lsr.status_id 
--         WHERE lsr.legacy_mapped_code = 'A'
```

I'll be available at 4 PM EST (or 4:30 PM EST if training runs over) to discuss further implementation details and address any questions about the modernization impact.
