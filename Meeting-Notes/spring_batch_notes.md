**Subject:** Meeting Request - Architecture Discussion for Dial Application Modernization

Hi Samuel,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the architectural approach we're taking for modernizing the Dial application. 

As we've been working on converting the legacy SQL-based processing to Spring Batch, I've started to have some concerns about whether this is the right fit for our use case. The current system is heavily SQL-centric with complex stored procedures, and I'm questioning whether forcing everything through Spring Batch's object-oriented processing model might actually hurt performance rather than improve it. Some of our file processing steps are already taking much longer than expected.

I'd like to explore alternative approaches, such as keeping the core SQL processing as-is and using Spring Boot primarily for orchestration, scheduling, and monitoring. This could give us the benefits of modern framework capabilities while preserving the database optimizations that our current system relies on.

Would you have time this week or early next week to discuss this? I think it's worth evaluating our options before we get too deep into the current implementation approach.

Let me know what works best for your schedule.

Thanks,
[Your name]
