  `body`: `**Subject: GetRefDt Transformation - Technical Discussion Summary**

**Meeting Date:** August 27, 2025

**Background & Issue:**
- Alert triggered on GetReferenceState function due to compilation failures
- Root cause: Dependencies on legacy ALS schema tables currently being transformed to modern structure
- Need to assess impact of ongoing table transformations on Entity dev schema

**Key Technical Findings:**

**Database Architecture Issues:**
- Entity system currently has direct access to OWL schema tables (architectural anti-pattern)
- Tight coupling exists between systems that should be decoupled
- Current approach violates separation of concerns principles

**Samuel's Technical Recommendations:**
- Conduct comprehensive audit of all ALS tables referenced in Entity code
- OWL team should have autonomy to modify their schema without affecting Entity
- Need complete inventory of ALS schema dependencies across all functions

**Proposed Solution Architecture:**
- Replace direct database access with API-based communication
- Implement service layer between Entity and OWL systems
- Consider GraphQL implementation for flexible data queries
- Establish proper boundaries between system domains

**Immediate Technical Tasks:**

1. **Schema Dependency Audit:**
   - Create Oracle stored procedure/function to identify all ALS schema references
   - Document all functions/queries using legacy ALS schema
   - Map dependencies in GetReferenceState and related functions

2. **Migration Strategy:**
   - Replace legacy table dependencies with modern equivalents
   - Work with Samuel, Diane, and SIA team on table mappings
   - Ensure business logic preservation during migration

3. **ETL Process Updates:**
   - Review ETL processes currently using legacy tables (accrual, pay_responses, payload_responses)
   - Assess CSUM table requirements for tin_summary integration
   - Evaluate Q_Send_It process optimization opportunities

**Tables Identified for Review:**
- PAY_REQ (pay request) - potentially removable from SIA process
- Pay_center, pay_request, pay_x_reference, ALS_pay tables
- Tin_summary_two and related \"two\" suffix tables

**Action Items:**
- Sharon: Create high-priority ticket for dependency removal work
- Team (Ranjitha, Paul, Speaker): Collaborate on API implementation
- Kamal: Loop into ongoing discussions
- All: Daily touchpoints until resolution

**Priority:** High - Database coupling represents significant technical debt and operational risk

Let me know if you need any clarification on the technical details or implementation approach.
