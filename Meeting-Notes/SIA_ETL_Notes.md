**Subject: ETL Testing & Validation Documentation - Action Required**

Hi Team,

Please find attached robust document templates for **ICS (Dailies/Weeklies), DIAL, and SIA ETL processes** that I've prepared based on Eddie's comments regarding validations and error management.

**Important Notes:**
- These templates contain comprehensive sections covering unit testing, pre-load validations, break testing, error reporting, GitHub structure, and ECP deployment
- **Not all sections may be relevant to your specific work** - please focus on the sections applicable to your component
- **Action Required:** Individual developers should:
  - Populate relevant sections with actual implementation details
  - Add relevant links (JIRA tickets, Confluence pages, GitHub repos, dashboards, etc.)
  - Include screenshots using **SnagIt** to illustrate configurations, workflows, and examples
  - Use **SnagIt callout icons** to highlight important areas in screenshots
  - Remove or mark as "N/A" any sections that don't apply

**Timeline:** Quick completion of these documents is essential for our modernization effort. Please prioritize this and complete your sections by **[INSERT DATE]**.

Let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any sections.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
