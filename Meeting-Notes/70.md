## Summary of Parameter Passing

**Confirmed:** Yes, the value `70` is being passed for 2 parameters.

**Flow:**
1. **Shell Script (`runrisk.csh`):**
   ```bash
   @combo_risk.sql $argv[1] 70 70
   ```

2. **SQL Parameters:**
   - `&1` = `$argv[1]` (user-provided command line argument)
   - `&2` = `70` (first hardcoded value)
   - `&3` = `70` (second hardcoded value)

3. **SQL Usage:**
   - The `grnum` filtering logic uses parameters `&2` and `&3`
   - Since both are `70`, the query filters for records where `grnum = 70`

**Business Implication:**
The combo risk analysis is configured to run with a fixed risk parameter/group number of `70`. This appears to be a specific risk category, threshold, or group identifier that's consistently used across the analysis. The fact that both parameters are the same value (70) suggests this might be filtering for a specific risk group or setting both a minimum and maximum threshold to the same value (effectively an exact match).

This is a common pattern in risk management systems where certain analyses are run for specific risk categories or groups identified by numeric codes.
